# ðŸ›’ Supermart Grocery Sales Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting grocery sales using real-world-like retail data. It combines Excel, SQL, and Machine Learning to extract insights and build a predictive model for sales.

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

To analyze historical grocery sales data and build a machine learning model that predicts sales based on product, location, discount, and time-related features. The project also aims to generate business insights for smarter inventory and pricing strategies.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

* **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning, pivot tables, trend charts
* **SQL** â€“ Data querying and insight extraction
* **Python** â€“ Machine Learning and data preprocessing
* **Libraries** â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains over 9,000 grocery orders with the following key features:

* Product Details: Category, Sub Category
* Order Info: City, Region, State, Order Date
* Financials: Sales, Profit, Discount
* Time Features: Order Day, Month, Year (engineered)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

* Cleaned date inconsistencies and converted to datetime
* Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`
* Extracted time-based features (day, month, year)
* Scaled numerical inputs using `StandardScaler`

## ðŸ§  Model Used

* **Linear Regression**
* Justification: Simple, interpretable baseline model for predicting continuous sales output based on numerical and categorical inputs

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation

* **RÂ² Score**: Measures how well the model explains sales variance
* **Mean Squared Error**: Measures average prediction error
* **Visualization**: Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted Sales

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights for Business

* Identify top-performing categories and cities
* Understand seasonal and regional sales trends
* Analyze the impact of discounts on profit and sales
* Predict sales to support stock planning and pricing
